#### Major changes over the old version:
- Fixed way too many bugs
- Updated the skin to work with Rainmeter 4.3
- Completely rewrote the code from scratch
- Completely redesigned everything
- Requires fewer external programs to work properly
- More focus on usability, lower resource consumption and better code readability
- Removed the music, weather and notes widget until I find a better solution for how to implement them

# This Rainmeter Skin requires some programs in order to work fully!
Those programs are:
1. [Core Temp](https://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/Core-Temp-setup.exe) for getting various CPU informations
2. [MSI Afterburner](http://www.guru3d.com/files-get/msi-afterburner-beta-download,33.html) for getting memory and core clock

## Special thanks to:
1. **theAzack9** for creating the insanely awesome FrostedGlass which enabled me to have this nice, blurry background on all the widgets. (https://forum.rainmeter.net/viewtopic.php?t=23106)
2. **The Rainmeter Documentation** for simply being an awesome and easy to learn and understand documentation of all the functions of Rainmeter! I don't even know what I would have done without it, it is simply great!
